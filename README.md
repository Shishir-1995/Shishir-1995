Hello Reader !!

About Me!

Known as SHISHIR PADHAN, a DATA SCIENTIST and DATA ANALYST and have completed my graduation in PHYSICS.

I Love Physics, Mathematics and Data Visualization. 

My journey and passion towards programming developed in 2020, and I started with C++ and JAVA. Then web development piqued my interest to in 2021, I dived into the world of HTML, CSS 
and JS. Although web development is a field of great learning, Mathematics and Statistics got better of me and Data Science tempted me due to which I learned Python and SQL.

Currently I identify myself as DATA SCIENTIST and apart from sitting and exploring and analysing data for hours, I do Dance, Poetry, Travelling and Cooking.

I believe reading books and listening to audio books greatly help a person in developing insights, which I do often.

I love riding bike and my last trip was to Darjeeling...

EXTRA INTEREST:

I love solving questions about the programming language so I am often on HackerRank and LeetCode, Although I have not tried competetive coding but looking forward to it.
Learning about new technology and going through Data to analyse and predict is something I do in my free time.
